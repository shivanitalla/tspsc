                    <p>Telangana State Public Service Commission is the youngest Public Service Commission in the country constituted vide GO Ms No.43, GA(Ser.A) Department, dt. 8.8.2014. Hyderabad State was one of the prominent princely State in India and inherits over 400 years of rich tradition and culture with unparalleled grace and historical significance. The system of selecting young talent for public services through a process of selection was in vogue in the Hyderabad State since the period of Mir Mahaboob Ali Pasha, VI Nizam (1869-1911). Hyderabad Civil Service Committee was established by the 1919 Firman and the Hyderabad Public Service Commission was established by a Firman on 27 April 1947 emulating the model of British Provincial Public Service Commission with a Chairman and Members not exceeding four in number. The establishment of the Commission was a significant landmark during the Asaf Jahi rule and brought the entire administrative machinery of civil services of the Nizam's State in tune with the modern times and Hyderabad Civil Service was considered a coveted and elite service in those days.</p><br>

                       <p>The Telangana State Public Service Commission, endowed with such rich legacy of over 150 years of recruiting young talent through selection, shall endeavour to make use of this heritage for selecting the best talents in Telangana for reconstruction and resurrecting the glorious past of Telangana.

                    <h5 class="ms-4">History of Hyderabad Public Service Commission:
                    </h5><br>
                    <p>The early Asaf Jahi rulers of the Hyderabad State followed the Mughal administrative traditions, practices and appointed public servants on the basis of nomination and representation. Until the time of Mir Mahaboob Ali Pasha, the Sixth Nizam, (1869-1911) no public officer of any category was appointed on the basis of selection and no foundation was laid for the creation of modern bureaucracy based on worth, merit and selection. After the assumption of full powers by the Nizam VI in 1884, a new era in the management of services had begun. Sir Salar Jung I, the Diwan (Prime Minister) was the creator of modern Hyderabad Civil Service. In 1882, Salar Jung issued the extraordinary Jareeda and emphasized the need of educating and training the young Hyderabadis for recruitment in the Nizam's Services. He propounded the idea of building an efficient administrative system on the model of British India and introduced several administrative reforms. He dismantled the old/archaic administrative structure and streamlined the public institutions by creating a distinct civil service class. The establishment of Zilabandi system, creation of Subedari and Taluqdari system, Revenue, Police and Judicial reforms by Salar Jung facilitated the formation of Hyderabad Civil Service. Subsequently, the proclamation of Qanuncha Mubarik of 1892, the Cabinet Council, and the Executive Council (1919) framed rules and regulations governing the services as well as regulated and institutionalized the Hyderabad Civil Services. These bodies further strengthened the scheme of administrative reforms introduced by Salar Jung I. Later, the different rules announced by the Nizams covered several aspects of the management of public servants like classification of services, appointments, promotions, salaries, superannuation and pension etc. The legal framework of the Hyderabad State Services was laid by the Rules and regulations codified in 1919.<br></p>
                    
                    <p>The presentation of 1892 Constitution by the Sixth Nizam, was considered as a landmark in the field of personnel management in the Hyderabad State. Likewise, under the 1919 Constitution, the ruler exercised sovereign authority over the serves. In accordance with the 1919 Firman, Hyderabad Civil Service Committee was established and as a personnel agency it played a significant role in the management of civil services. It was independent in its functioning and no attempt was made to bring pressure on the decision-making process of the Committee. It was a multifunctional agency and closely associated with all aspects of Hyderabad Civil Service. It had to conduct examinations for the selection and placement of the candidates for the various vacancies in different departments.<br>

                    <p>The presentation of 1892 Constitution by the Sixth Nizam, was considered as a landmark in the field of personnel management in the Hyderabad State. Likewise, under the 1919 Constitution, the ruler exercised sovereign authority over the serves. In accordance with the 1919 Firman, Hyderabad Civil Service Committee was established and as a personnel agency it played a significant role in the management of civil services. It was independent in its functioning and no attempt was made to bring pressure on the decision-making process of the Committee. It was a multifunctional agency and closely associated with all aspects of Hyderabad Civil Service. It had to conduct examinations for the selection and placement of the candidates for the various vacancies in different departments.

                        In 1938, through a resolution of the Executive Council a Committee was constituted comprising of all Secretaries to Government with the Finance Member as the President and an officer of the Finance Department as Secretary to examine the possibility and role of an agency or agencies for recruitment and appointment and its/their sphere(s) of action. After detailed discussion, it was recommended to establish an independent and impartial recruitment agency, known as the Hyderabad Public Service Commission. The Committee opined that the efficiency of an administration depends on its personnel. It is therefore evident that the procedure of recruitment especially for the higher services of the administration, play an important role in creating and maintaining its standard and efficiency. Accordingly, the Hyderabad Public Service Commission was established by a Firman on 27 April 1947. The establishment of the Commission was a significant landmark in the organization and management of civil services during the Asaf Jahi rule. It brought the entire administrative machinery of civil services of the Nizam's State in tune with the modern times. The¿ Hyderabad Civil Service, was a coveted service in the¿ State of Hyderabad. It was considered to be an elite service, and the best of the government officers were inducted into it through a competitive examination. It was abolished¿ after the Police Action in 1948 and its Officers were absorbed into the Indian government civil services.<br></p>
                    <p>The Hyderabad Public Service Commission was constituted on the model of British Provincial Public Service Commission with similar functions. It consisted of a Chairman and Members not exceeding four in number. They were appointed by His Highness the Nizam on the recommendation of the President of the Executive Council. The Chairman and Members of the Hyderabad Public Service Commission were not permitted to further employment after relinquishing their office.</p><br>
